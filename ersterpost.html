    <h1><strong>I'm going on an Adventure!</strong></h1> 
    <div>
        <h3> So this is supposed to be my first blogpost for this blog about C++ programming. The only problem is, that it has to be written in html or markdown for that matter.<br>
            I decided to stick to html and build a webpage for my own. So here we go in learning to set up a website using html and css eventually. </h3>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            So this gets me to the first fun thing about coding. Even though html is not as complex as real programming languages, it does come with it's own unique challanges. And you know how Barney Stinson would put it: <br>
            <iframe class="center" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nepysk5rOf4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </p>
        <p> 
            What I really do not appreciate about this is, that i will not be able to fully focus on C++ in the beginning, until my html knowledge is good enough to just write my blogposts in Virtual Studio Code and migrating it to github. As you probably guessed: My blog is distributed through github as a static Webpage. 
        
        </p>
    <div> 
        <h2>
            So where am I in my <strong>Main Adventure</strong>?
        </h2>
        <div>
            Right now I am following a Tutorial by <a href="GameDev.TV"><bold>GameDev.TV</bold></a> to build a Game named "Toon Tanks". I made some adjustments to the used Material so that the game looks a little nicer for you guys to look at. 
            The main goal is to learn how to control a pawn, set up the camera and get it moving accordingly to your input. Next up is to adjust the movement speed and the local rotation of the turret mesh, I guess by using player input with the mouse.<br>

            <p>Here is, what my level looks like at the moment:</p>
            <img src="ToonTanksImage.png" alt="My Level Design" width="742" height="353" class="center">
            <p>Edit: I just looked this page up on my phone and I most definately have to improve the formatting of the image. But thats something I will be tackling later on.</p>
            <p>In the bottom right you can see the pawn Tank with its capsule, a camera. It already has the ability to get forward and backward movement. The orange turrets are the enemey in this tutorial which will be shooting projectiles at me.</p>
        </div>

        <p> So that will wrap up my first Blog post. Let's see, where more progress will happen. In <bold>HTML/ CSS</bold> or in <bold>C++ and Unreal</bold>. </p>
