    <h1><strong>I'm going on an Adventure!</strong></h1> 
    <div>
        <h3> So this is supposed to be my first blogpost for this blog about C++ programming. The only problem is, that it has to be written in html or markdown for that matter.<br>
            I decided to stick to html and build a webpage for my own. So here we go in learning to set up a website using html and css eventually. </h3>

    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            So this gets me to the first fun thing about coding. Even though html is not as complex as real programming languages, it does come with it's own unique challanges.
        </p>
        <p> 
            What I really do not appreciate about this is, that i will not be able to fully focus on C++ in the beginning, until my html knowledge is good enough to just write my blogposts in Virtual Studio Code and migrating it to github. As you probably guessed: My blog is distributed through github as a static Webpage. 
        
        </p>
    <div> 
        <h2>
            So where am I in my <strong>Main Adventure</strong>?
        </h2>
        <div>
            Right now I am following a Tutorial by <a href="GameDev.TV"><bold>GameDev.TV</bold></a> to build a Game named "Toon Tanks". I made some adjustments to the used Material so that the game looks a little nicer for you guys to look at. 
            The main goal is to learn how to control a pawn, set up the camera and get it moving accordingly to your input. Next up is to adjust the movement speed and the local rotation of the turret mesh, I guess by using player input with the mouse.<br>
            I'll add some screenshots soon.  
        </div>

        <p> So that will wrap up my first Blog post. Let's see, where more progress will happen. In <bold>HTML/ CSS</bold> or in <bold>C++ and Unreal</bold>. </p>
