  <h1>Hello again!</h1>
  <p>Today you'll get my first real update on how my coding in C++ is improving. Since I already use some basic css to get the looks of the blog to some "higher standard", you'll get to see most of the visual upgrades for every blogpost, past and present.</p>

  <h2>Project Toon Tanks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Todays accomplishments:</li>
    <li>
      Set up the movement speed of the Tank using Fvector and the Delta Time component<br>
    </li>
    <li> 
      Adjusted the collision sweeping of my Tank(CapsuleSphere as Root Component) so it was blocked by other world objects.<br>
       Took me a little while to figure out why I couldn't move after implementing collision. But then it occured to me:<br> The capsule was overlapping with the ground mesh, so it was blocked from the beginning. <br>
    </li>
    <li>
      After I fixed that, Rotation was to be implemented. Adding FRotator and adding a rotation function for the turn rate using UGameplayStatics.<br>
      (Question if anyone reads this: Why am I not able to get the definition of FRotator? I just get the definition of TRotator. Help please!)<br>
    </li>
    <li>
      The next step will make the mouse Movement (Controller Input) rotate the turret of the tank pawn. I got introduced to the Cast function. Very confusing since the explanation used the word pointer like 20 times. <br>
      I'm still not sure, what pointers actually do. Should get this straight at some point in the near future. <br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Next up is creating hit results/ casting. So first I got the system to draw a debug sphere into the world/ onto my tank. <br>
      <img src= "Debugsphere.png" alt="pngofdebugsphere" width="40%" ></a> <iframe style ="position:relative; top:-100px; left:30px;" src="https://giphy.com/embed/VRKheDy4DkBMrQm66p" width="220" height="220" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed"></iframe><p></p><br>
      The next task was to create a Debugsphere at the position of the cursor, which was created by the funktion GetHitResultUnderCursor() with a reference to a pointer(?!) to the PlayerController.
    </li>
    <li>
      Learned the difference between simple and complex collision. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Got the Rotation of the Tank Turret in place. used a rotation function in the base pawn file to get to use the rotation function for the enemy turrets later on.<br>
      Here is what it looks like:<br>
      <video width=25% height=25% controls loop>
      <source  src="TurretRotation.mp4" type=video/mp4> 
      <source  src="TurretRotation.mp4" type=video/ogg> 
      </video>
        <p><em>You spin me right round baby, right round</em></p>
      </li> 
  </ul>
