  <h1><strong>Legal Computational Studies</strong></h1>
  <p>As you know I am currently a student at Philipps-Universität Marburg. During the Covid Lockdown I got to get in touch with a lawyer who had special interest in the field of Legal Tech.<br>
  This man helped me get engaged into the topic as well. "But what does that have to do with this blog", you might ask.</p>
  <p>As you probably know I seem to have an issue with sticking to one topic and wanting to learn everything at once.<br> Well today I started learning at <a href="elegal.de">eLegal.de</a> which is a learning platform by students of the Georg-August Universität Göttingen (my hometown). They started a hackathon today which is patroned by the Federal Justice Department of Germany.<br>
  <p>What I will try to accomplish is, to make <a href="Legalcomputingstudies.html">this page</a> entirely focused on my legal tech studies and eventual even some output.</p>
  
  <p>After doing some other things I finished another CSS tutorial. Colors are now something I can put into a CSS file in 4(?!) different ways?! I mean... You could just find what color you like in the different boxes in the IDE but...whatever. <br>
   Now I am able to use coded colors.</p>
