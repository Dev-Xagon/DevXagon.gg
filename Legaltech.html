  <h1>So, what is Legal Computation?</h1>
  <p>Many of you might ask what is Legal Tech/ Legal computation? Of course you can split this topic into many different sections. But all of those would be described by this sentence (correct me if I am mistaken of course!):"Legal computation is the complement for the connection between the logical fundamentals of law and the client." <br>
    If you are able to automate process of getting the fundamental logical fields of your clients legal problem, and hints as to where the solutions might be, you can not only speed up the process of getting legal justice for this client, you as a business can safe a lot of time and effort usually used to get fundamental data or documents needed for further evaluation of the problem in question. So you would not only be able to potentially solve more cases, you can also make law more accessible for everyday people.</p>
  <p>If you think of your last, and let it be a very small problem, that you had and thought of"oh man why should I take on the financial and disrupting process of asking a lawyer about this problem?!"</p>
  <p>Even for myself, an aspiring lawyer, the question of wanting to get my claims by pursuing a potentially stressfull lawsuit is frequently in my head.</p>
  <P>Now think about how your problem gets solved if say you last Buy at eBay did not go as planned. You paid with lets say PayPal and you bought your item from a business. You get back your money by PayPal. But what is going on behind the scenes?</P>
  <p>As you probably guessed, a software got on to the problem and connected your description of the problem with the business person. Then another form will be filled out eventually. This, again, will be analysed by a software as to what might be the topic in question, and which juristiction applies in this case.</p>
  <p>Now I would say it would take, at least 30 minutes of work by trained people (lawyers, assistents, secretaries) to only get the fundamental logic applying parameters of the problem. Pretty annoying work and very expensive as well.</p>
  <p>The software on the other hand is running, waiting for Input by the user (costumer and businessperson) and gives a trained person the problem and both standpoints.<br>
    Now the problem will be processed internally and if it seems nessessary that the problem has to be solved by a court, you already have pretty much all data to at least let a judge decide as to what should happen. Which by the way doesn't only save money but also valuable time of the judge.<br>
    It would mean a huge discharge on the judicial system if it were to implement only the babysteps of technology designed to help people get to know if they have a chance on claiming their rights.</p>
